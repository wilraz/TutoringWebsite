					Tips for success through Tutoring and Study:
					</h2>
					</br>
				</strong>
				</p>

				<p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Contact your tutor well in advance if you are studying for a test or need help with an assignment that is due in the very near future. You will need time to implement the changes or techniques into your assignment or independent study sessions following your tutoring sessions.
						</br></br>
					</li>					
					<li>
						Explain specifically what you are having trouble with in your course. The act of doing this will allow you to formulate coherent questions to ask, and will substantially improve the quality of your tutoring sessions.
						</br></br>
					</li>					
					<li>
						Make sure that you are on time for your sessions, and that you turn off your phone. You are compensating your tutor for his or her time; however, it is essential that you display interest in the subject matter. Distractions can rapidly alter the positive course of a tutoring session. 
						</br></br>					
					<li>
						Ask questions, no matter how trivial you think the tutor will say they are; an unanswered question could possibly be the one question on the exam that gets you a decent grade.
						</br></br>
					</li>					
					<li>
						If you believe that your tutor is not a good fit for you, consider asking for a replacement. There is nothing wrong with not “clicking” with another person, especially a tutor. Do not make the decision that your tutoring session is bad during the session; all of our tutors are well qualified to give you the needed help to pass your courses, and it does take a great deal of effort on your part to make the sessions truly worthwhile.
						</br></br>					
					</li>					
					<li>
						Do not expect your tutor to do your homework for you. If you put no effort into your homework, the exam on that material is going to be painful.
						</br></br>
					</li>					
					<li>
						Adopt good study habits; one tutoring session is not going to prepare you completely for a test on the material. Repetition is helpful, as is employing the correct techniques, which you should try to learn from your tutor as soon as possible. You must practice to get good at anything; academics is no exception to this rule.
						</br></br>
